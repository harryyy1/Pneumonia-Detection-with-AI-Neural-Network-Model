# Pneumonia-Detection-with-AI-Neural-Network-Model
Pneumonia Detection with an AI Neural Network model employs deep learning to swiftly and accurately identify pneumonia in medical images, aiding healthcare professionals in making timely and precise diagnoses.

## Overview
This repository contains an AI Neural Network model developed to detect pneumonia in medical images, particularly chest X-rays or CT scans. Pneumonia is a critical respiratory condition, and this model utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to analyze and identify pneumonia-related patterns in these images, providing invaluable support to healthcare professionals for early and accurate diagnosis. 
Neural Network Machine learning is a method in which computers process data in a way that works similarily to our biological human brain. 

## Key Features
- Utilizes deep neural networks for automated pneumonia detection.
- Trained on a diverse dataset of labeled medical images.
- Provides rapid and reliable results, assisting healthcare professionals in making timely decisions.
- Offers the potential to improve patient care and outcomes through early detection.
- 76.5% accuracy. Slightly worse than the CNN Model. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment to open the provided model and code.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the model, preprocess images, and perform pneumonia detection.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for evaluation)
- imgaug (for data augmentation)

## Usage
1. Load the pre-trained model and required libraries.
2. Prepare the chest X-ray or CT scan images you wish to analyze.
3. Use the model to make predictions on the images.
4. Interpret the results to determine the presence or absence of pneumonia.

Note:
The model was trained on a labeled dataset of medical images, including pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative cases. To replicate or expand upon this work, you can obtain similar datasets from medical imaging repositories or research institutions.

## Improvements for the Future:
* Implement more sophisticated data augmentation techniques to simulate real-world variations in medical images.
* Explore deploying the model in healthcare settings and gather feedback from medical professionals to refine its performance.
